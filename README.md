# Project-of-DataScience-Course
This is a final project of a data science course from Yeditepe University.


In this data analysis project, we began by reading a dataset and renaming a specific column to facilitate coding. Subsequently, we cleaned the data by replacing missing or negative values with zeros and transformed certain columns into factors for categorical analysis. Using visualization techniques in ggplot2, we created a pie chart representing investments by technology, a line plot illustrating investment trends over time, and a stacked area plot showing cumulative investment by region over time. Additionally, we explored regions with the highest investments in energy technologies and compared renewable versus non-renewable categories. To gain deeper insights, we employed neural network models using the neuralnet and nnet packages, predicting future investment amounts based on input variables like region, technology, year, and category.
